# Nutrio App Backend

This is the Spring Boot REST API for my Final thesis

The Nutrio software solution is designed to help users manage their diet and maintain health, especially in the context of increasingly unhealthy eating habits in today's fast-paced world. The solution offers personalized meal plans and recipes, taking into account users' health issues, allergies, and available ingredients. Unlike existing solutions on the market, Nutrio generates recipes based on ingredients users already have and warns about potentially harmful foods. By utilizing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, Nutrio helps users adopt healthier eating habits, thereby improving their overall health. In the development of this work Vue.js was used for the client application, along with a Spring Boot REST server and a MongoDB database.
